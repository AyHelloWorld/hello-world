Cypher为列表提供了相当遍历的操作，如range, collect, unwind, reduce, extract, filter, size等

# range, 可用于生成一个列表:
RETURN range(0, 10), range(2, 18, 3)

# Collect将所有值收集到一个集合list中。
WITH [1, 1, 2, 2] AS coll
UNWIND coll AS x
WITH DISTINCT x
RETURN collect(x) AS SET

# unwind,将一个列表拆解为单个值：
UNWIND[1,2,3] AS x
RETURN x


WITH ['John', 'Mark', 'Jonathan', 'Bill'] AS somenames
UNWIND somenames AS names
WITH names AS candidate
WHERE candidate STARTS WITH 'Jo'
RETURN candidate
